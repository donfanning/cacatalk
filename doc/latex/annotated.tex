\section{\-Class \-List}
\-Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\-:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{struct__window}{\-\_\-window} \\*\-A \-Window structure encapsulates the dimensions of the window and the amount by which the text within it has been scrolled. \-The line\-\_\-at\-\_\-top member is the lowest index of all lines in the text buffer that is currently visible in the window, i.\-e., the index of the top line on the screen. \-Only complete lines are displayed, so line\-\_\-at\-\_\-top is the index of the line whose entire contents are visible }{\pageref{struct__window}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structbuffer}{buffer} \\*\-A buffer place holder to be used with video streaming buffers given by the v4l device }{\pageref{structbuffer}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structimage}{image} \\*\-An image object to indicate the corresponding pixels of a video buffer in memory and other parameters, such as widht, height (pixels) and the caca dither format of choice }{\pageref{structimage}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structoptions__s}{options\-\_\-s} \\*\-This structure stores the argument options needed across the program. \-It will be called from a few different places if modification/setting of an member argument is needed }{\pageref{structoptions__s}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structtextentry}{textentry} \\*\-A buffer for text entry as uint32 characters used for putting characters in caca canvas }{\pageref{structtextentry}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structvideo__out__args__s}{video\-\_\-out\-\_\-args\-\_\-s} \\*\-Structure of arguments passed to a thread (also is going to be made global to be able to shut the video on and off) }{\pageref{structvideo__out__args__s}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structvideo__params__s}{video\-\_\-params\-\_\-s} \\*\-This structure stores the video device parameters that are used for streaming video frames with \-V4\-L2 }{\pageref{structvideo__params__s}}{}
