\-A \-Window structure encapsulates the dimensions of the window and the amount by which the text within it has been scrolled. \-The line\-\_\-at\-\_\-top member is the lowest index of all lines in the text buffer that is currently visible in the window, i.\-e., the index of the top line on the screen. \-Only complete lines are displayed, so line\-\_\-at\-\_\-top is the index of the line whose entire contents are visible.
