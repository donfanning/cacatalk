 A Window structure encapsulates the dimensions of the window and the
 amount by which the text within it has been scrolled. The  line_at_top
 member is the lowest index of all lines in the text buffer that is currently
 visible in the window, i.e., the index of the top line on the screen.
 Only complete lines are displayed, so line_at_top is the index of the
 line whose entire contents are visible.
