 *  \brief The \e cacatalk public header.
 *
 Course         : CS 82010 UNIX Application Development (Spring 2013)
 Created on     : May 24, 2013
 Description    : A very simple video and text chat interface (peer-to-peer (non centralized)) based on libcaca
 License        : â€‹Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License (WTFPL)
 Purpose        : To demonstrate some of the principles used to transfer data using sockets,
 a wrapper around ncurses (via libcaca), the use of the Linux Media Infrasture API (a.k.a. V4L2),
 threads, and the pure awesomeness of CACA itself (Color AsCii Art).

 Usage          : cacatalk  [-p address] [-v video_device_path] [-d caca_driver_style(1-7)]

 Options        :
                 -p address     Sets the reachable peer as a dotted decimal IPv4 address or network resolvable hostname
                 -v video_device_path  Sets the path to the video device (e.g /dev/video0)
                 -d caca_driver_style  The argument value is a number from 1 to 7,
                   and it allows to choose the environment of cacatalk,
                   Possible values represent (1: Default, 2: ncurses terminal, 3: conio, 4: GL, 5: raw, 6: VGA, 7: slang)

 ---- See below for detailed usage instructions ---
 Build with     : make

 Status         : First release (Initial development), so code needs to be cleaned and bugs killed
 The following functionally exists for caca talking:
 1) 'cacatalk' can be run from the command line without arguments at all), and they could be set during runtime from the main menu.
 2) Video stream (if valid device has been open) can be toggle on/off during chat session by pressing 'Ctr+V'
 3) 'cacatalk' uses 2 stream sockets (bidirectional). The text (chat) socket operates on port 25666. The video stream socket uses
 25667. Both peers are listening on 25666, but whoever initiates the connection (by pressing 'c' in the main menu) becomes
 the client who also starts listening on port 25667 for the peer to connect to. All this happens transparently.

 \bugs There maybe issues at quiting a connection when the other peer is still transmitting video data (socket lingers)

 \todo
 - Parametrize dimension values, such as video resolution (for now it's set statically to grab a 640x480 video),
 and the produced caca image uses 16 lines (rows).

 -Scrolling
 The program doesn't scroll (nor saves) ongoing text chats (also after leaving the chatroom).
 Also, there are only 5 entries for send/receive text chat.


 Design
 The program has two canvas:
  1) a presentation canvas on which menus and the chat room are drawn. buffer and a screen. The text buffer.
  2) a background canvas running on a thread that polls video and sends to the peer.
